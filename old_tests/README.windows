To run the TC_AppConfig, TC_CGI_Adaptor, and TC_NoSubclass tests on Windows machines,
the win32/process library must be installed.

This can be found on Rubyforge at http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.

If you use rubygems, it can be installed with:

gem install win32-process

If you do not have them installed, the IOWA installed will detect this and install
versions bundled in the distribution.
