# IOWA v1.0.0

## History

IOWA is a web development framework for Ruby. The name is an acronym for
Internet Objects for Web Applications. It started life in 2001 as a proof of
concept idea written by Avi Bryant. In 2002, it was taken over by Kirk Haines
and developed into a framework suitable for production application use. In the
intervening years, it is has been used on hundreds of production applications.

## What Is It?

IOWA is a web development framework that, while providing all of the typical
tools for request parsing, response generation, and separation of concerns
between views, controllers, and models, it also provides a facility for
simplifying the job of state management in an application by making it
transparent. Applications can set state during one request/response cycle, and
that state will still exist on the following request/response cycle.
